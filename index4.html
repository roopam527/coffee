You will find that baristas in different countries make short macchiatos differently. However the traditional way of making a short macchiato is as follows: <br><br>

• 1 Shot of espresso in a short glass or espresso cup• A dollop of steamed milk and foam placed on top of the espresso <br><br>

Barista tip: The key to the perfect short macchiato is the rule of thirds. That is you want three different colored layers in the macchiato. A bottom dark layer to represent the espresso, a middle layer that mixes the espresso and the milk, and a top layer of predominantly steamed milk. Refer to the picture above as an example.</p> </div>
